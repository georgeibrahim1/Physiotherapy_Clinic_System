1) Test0 is the same as Test1 but with Pcancel & Presc:

It covers most of the scenarios:

-Patients with PT=VT ,PT<VT ,PT>VT.
-Scenario of R patient entering non-empty waiting list depending on treatment latency.
-Scenario where In-Treatment list is sorted according to timestep+Duration.
-Scenario where X_Room is full.
-Scenario of early & late patient.
-Scenario of late patient entering a waitlist that has multiple patients ,but still the late patient is the first to be dequeued(sorted by PT+penalty).
-Scenario where the waiting list is empty & hence enters In-Treatment list directly.

2) Test2
-It covers more number of patients which makes things more complex.
-Increased the number of R patients.
-Has a Pcancel & Preschedule 
-Increased load on early list

4) Test4:

5) Test5:
